## Incarceration

Measuring the cost of incarceration is difficult, because costs are both direct and indirect. The average estimate of the three sources below was $378.96 Billion, but their methods differed significantly.

| Total Spending | [Who Pays? The True Cost of Incarceration on Families](http://ellabakercenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/who-pays.pdf) | $80 Billion | Federal and State Spending | 2015 | 
| Full Cost | The Economic Burden of Incarceration in the U.S.](https://advancingjustice.wustl.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/The%20Economic%20Burden%20of%20Incarceration%20in%20the%20US.pdf) | $1.014 Trillion | Study | 2016 |

#### Institute for Advancing Justice Research and Innovation

In the paper [The Economic Burden of Incarceration in the U.S.](https://advancingjustice.wustl.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/The%20Economic%20Burden%20of%20Incarceration%20in%20the%20US.pdf), researchers argue that the cost of operating correctional institutions only represents 9% of the full social cost of Incarceration. Their estimate of $1.014 Trillion in total costs is 52% borne by families, children, and communities, and 39% borne by the prisoners themselves. The two tables below illustrate the latter two categories of costs. 

##### Cost Borne By Prisoners

| Cost | $ (Billions) |
| Reduction in lifetime earnings of incarcerated persons | 230.0 |
| Lost wages while incarcerated | 70.5 |
| Higher mortality rate of formerly incarcerated persons | 62.6 |
| Nonfatal injuries to incarcerated persons | 28.0 |
| Fatal injuries to incarcerated persons | 1.7
| Total | 392.6 | 

##### Cost Borne By Families, Children, and Communities

| Cost | $ (Billions) |
| Criminogenic nature of prison | 285.8 |
| Increased criminality of children of incarcerated parents | 130.6 |
| Children's education level and subsequent wages as an adult | 30.0 |
| Marginal excess burden | 17.8 |
| Divorce | 17.7 |
| Decreased property values | 11.0 |
| Adverse health effects | 10.2 |
| Reduced marriage | 9.0 |
| Child welfare | 5.3 |
| Interest on criminal justice debt | 5.0 |
| Reentry programs, nonprofits, movement to end mass incarceration | 2.9 | 
| Homelessness of formerly incarcerated persons | 2.2 |
| Infant mortality | 1.2 |
| Children rendered homeless by parental incarceration | 0.9 |
| Visitation costs | 0.8 |
| Moving costs | 0.5 |
| Eviction costs | 0.2 |
| Total | 531.0 |

#### Ella Baker Center, Forward Together, and Research Action Design

In the 2015 report [Who Pays? The True Cost of Incarceration on Families](http://ellabakercenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/who-pays.pdf), Saneta deVuono-powell, Chris Schweidler, Alicia Walters, and Azadeh Zohrabi published a widely cited estimate suggesting that the cost of incarceration to the US Economy was $80 Billion a year. 

* The research included surveys with 712 formerly incarcerated people, 368 family members of the formerly incarcerated, 27 employers, and 34 focus groups with family members and individuals impacted by incarceration.
* Nearly 2 in 3 families (65%) with an incarcerated member were unable to meet their familyâ€™s basic needs. 
More than half of those entering the criminal justice system live at or below the poverty line ($11,770 per year annual income) when sentenced and over two-thirds of those in jail reported incomes of less than $12,000 per year.

#### The Vera Institute

In their [2015 Estimate of spending on incarceration](https://storage.googleapis.com/vera-web-assets/downloads/Publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/legacy_downloads/the-price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends.pdf), The Vera Institute conducted a survey of state prison expenditures. It contains the following findings: 

* 45 States spent $42.89 Billion on incarceration in 2015. 
* California alone spent $8 Billion. 
* Alaska, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont had a cost per inmate above $50,000.
