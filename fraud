# Fraud

It's hard to know how much fraud there is. 

Perpetrators naturally try to keep their work to themselves, and there is a tendency for estimates of its full reach to sound like nebulous conspiracy theories. Good data is hard to come by. 

We avoid this by staying close to authoritative data, and by aggregating a range of estimates and observations from credible sources. 

## Council of Fraud Examiners

In their [2016 Report to Nations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acfepublic/2016-report-to-the-nations.pdf), the Council of Fraud Examiners provides the following :

* $6.3 Billion was lost in 2,410 fraud cases that took place in 114 countries. 
* The Fraud Examiners' estimate of the total cost of fraud for all organizations was 5% of annual spending each year. 
* Median losses from individual frauds that lasted for 60 months or more were estimated at $850,000, and the length of a fraud is directly correlated with its severity.

In their study [The Financial Cost of Fraud](http://www.pkf.com/media/31640/PKF-The-financial-cost-of-fraud-2015.pdf), Jim Gee and Mark Button write "It is clear that fraud and error losses in any organisation should currently be expected to be at least 3%, probably almost 6% and possibly more than 10%" of expenditure. They also provide the following data, based on a 17 year long examination of 382 fraud prevention efforts: 

* The global average loss rate they have observed is 5.6% of annual spending. 
* 69% of losses were greater than 3% of annual spending.
* An [update](https://www.pkf-littlejohn.com/sites/default/files/media/documents/annual_fraud_indicator_report_2016update.pdf) notes that public sector fraud accounted for 5.5% of spending by local and central government in the UK from 2013/14.
