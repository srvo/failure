#### Council of Fraud Examiners

In their [2016 Report to Nations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acfepublic/2016-report-to-the-nations.pdf), the Council of Fraud Examiners provides the following :

* $6.3 Billion was lost in the 2,410 fraud cases examined. 
* The Fraud Examiners' average estimate of the total cost of fraud for all organizations was 5% of annual spending each year. 
* Median losses from individual frauds that lasted for 60 months or more were estimated at $850,000, and the length of a fraud is directly correlated with its severity. 

#### Center for Counter Fraud Studies at the University of Pourtsmouth and PKF Littlejohn

In their study [The Financial Cost of Fraud](http://www.pkf.com/media/31640/PKF-The-financial-cost-of-fraud-2015.pdf), Jim Gee and Mark Button write "It is clear that fraud and error losses in any organisation should currently be expected to be at least 3%, probably almost 6% and possibly more than 10%" of expenditure. They also provide the following data, based on a 17 year long examination of 382 fraud prevention efforts: 

* The global average loss rate they have observed is 5.6% of annual spending. 
* 69% of losses were greater than 3% of annual spending.
* An [update](https://www.pkf-littlejohn.com/sites/default/files/media/documents/annual_fraud_indicator_report_2016update.pdf) notes that public sector fraud accounted for 5.5% of spending by local and central government in the UK from 2013/14.
