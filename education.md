This section is a work in progress. It will be important to separate estimated cumulative effects from annual effects.

#### McKinsey & Company

A 2009 [McKinsey Report](http://dropoutprevention.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ACHIEVEMENT_GAP_REPORT_20090512.pdf) argues that gaps in educational acheivement "impose on the united states the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession." Their report and its [detailed findings](https://ed.sc.gov/scdoe/assets/File/tests/middle/naep/DetailedEconomicImpactFindings.pdf) suggest that 2008 GDP could be between $1.3 Trillion and $2.3 Trillion higher as a result of closing these gaps. 

#### Center for American Progress

A 2014 [Center for American Progress report](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2014/11/10/100577/the-economic-benefits-of-closing-educational-achievement-gaps/) argues that GDP Growth would be $551 Billion higher every year from 2014 to 2050 as a result of closing the acheivement gap.

[The Economic Impact of Acheivement Gaps in Pennsylvania's Public Schools](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1159.html)

If student performance gaps based on race-ethnicity or family economic status were closed for future cohorts, each annual cohort in Pennsylvania would gain $3 billion to $5 billion in present-value lifetime compensation and nonmarket benefits. These social gains from closing race-ethnic gaps equate to approximately $83,000 to $125,000 in present-value dollars per African-American and Latino students
