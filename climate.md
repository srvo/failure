A [paper](https://www.eenews.net/assets/2015/01/13/document_cw_01.pdf) from Frances Moore and Delavane Diaz published in *Nature Climate Change* argues that "each temperature shock has a persistent effect that permanently lowers GDP below what it would otherwise be." They present a paper suggesting that: 

*  In a "business as usual" scenario, average annual growth rate in poor regions is cut from 3.2% to 2.6%, which means that by 2100 per-capita GDP is 40% below reference. 
* Widely used [DICE](https://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwan/ee-0564-114.pdf/$file/ee-0564-114.pdf) models do not adequately account for the ongoing cost of climate change.
* The social cost of carbon should be estimated in the context of these ongoing costs.
