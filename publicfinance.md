Many states and municipalities are approaching preventable disaster. 

Gabriel Petek, a municipal bond analyst at Standard And Poor's, [wrote in April 2017](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/state-local-politics/327199-your-state-may-be-facing-the-dawn-of-an-unforgiving) that changes in demographics and the economy have left "institutions inadequate" to correct against financial excess. 

He continues:  

> There is an asymmetry to the new era for state finances. While the budgetary gains to states during the current expansion have been subdued, recent downdrafts have been severe. In the aggregate, from 1951 through 2001, [state tax revenues never posted year-over-year declines, but have done so three times in just the past 15 years](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/stc.html).

These unprecedented revenue declines come as many cities still have not regained firm financial footing since the financial crisis. [A 2017 Survey](http://nlc.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/NLC%20City%20Fiscal%20Conditions%202017.pdf) from the National League of Cities shows that general fund revenues still have not recovered since the 2007 recession, and stood at 97.7% of 2006 levels. General funds are used to support cities' general operations and represent 55% of total city spending on average. 

These challenges have not gone unnoticed by municipal analysts. PNC's Tom Kozlik [writes](https://www.pnc.com/content/dam/pnc-com/pdf/corporateandinstitutional/MunicipalBond/US-State-Fiscal-Health-Lesson-from-Post-Recession-Miscue-11-1-17.pdf): 

> State governments still have a significant amount of control over revenues and spending, but the problem is they are not using that control. 
With pensions, state control is often limited. As a result, U.S. state credit quality is deteriorating. Further, by and large I am not seeing the necessary pension reforms that could correct this credit deterioration. 
> I would go so far as to say that the rating agencies, despite the downgrades and the noted warnings, are still underestimating the stress pensions are—and will be—putting on state and local government credit profiles. I believe one reason is because of how difficult it will be for states with substantial pension burdens to reverse course, and improve their credit standing. 
> Currently, Moody’s has seven state ratings with “Negative” outlooks and S&P has eight state ratings with “Negative” outlooks. Expecting near-term political solutions to solve these financial circumstances may be optimistic.
