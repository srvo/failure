Harvard-based Physician Task Force on Hunger in America announced the results of its research and field investigations in half the states of the nation (Physician Task Force on Hunger in America, 1985). They reported that the number of Americans afflicted by hunger was more than 20 million. Their report led to significant national news coverage and, as in 1968



###Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition in the U.S. (1968)

when it reported in 1968 on the widespread occurrence of hungry
children, the elderly, even entire families (Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and
Malnutrition, 1967). While the Board, largely comprised of physicians and clergy, was unable to
estimate precisely how many individuals were impacted, they placed the number somewhere
above 10 million people. 

One even suggested that the number was well above 30 million (Bregglio, 1992), a figure later
corroborated by the university-based Center on Hunger and Poverty in 19922, which had been
consulted by Congressional leaders as to the true extent of domestic hunger.

### Brown, Shephard, Martin, & Orwat 2007

In 1995, the federal government implemented a standard measure to evaluate the extent of hunger annually. The governmental report defines hunger as a “painful sensation” in the stomach, and
the measure of it reflects a high degree of food deprivation or “insecurity” before a household
actually is considered to experience hunger. Some nutritionists and medical experts consider
this standard to be too high. Since “pain” is only one of the possible sensations from hunger,
many victims of hunger do not actually feel pain as such. Thus, people can be chronically
hungry by any common understanding of the term, yet be missed by the federal definition
because they do not experience “a painful sensation.” 

Tens of thousands of “emergency” feeding programs now dot the landscape of
the nation, so many in fact that if they were evenly distributed, about one thousand would exist
in each state of the fifty states. (Cohen, 2006). 


### The Perryman Group
hunger costs the economy $461.9 billion in total expenditures, $221.9 billion in gross product each year, and nearly 2.5 million permanent jobs.  These amounts represent about 1.3% of total output in the United States and 1.8% of total domestic employment, thus reflecting a significant drain on current business activity.  It should be noted that the lifetime effects of hunger occurring in 2014 alone (as opposed to the impacts in a typical year as described above) are much larger and include almost $3.4 trillion in aggregate spending, over $1.5 trillion in gross product, and 15.9 million years of employment.

(85.7%) of households were food secure throughout the year in 2013

17.5 million US households (almost 50 million people) had difficulty obtaining sufficient food last year, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security in the United States in 2013 report released in September 2014
