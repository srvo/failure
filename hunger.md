hunger costs the economy $461.9 billion in total expenditures, $221.9 billion in gross product each year, and nearly 2.5 million permanent jobs.  These amounts represent about 1.3% of total output in the United States and 1.8% of total domestic employment, thus reflecting a significant drain on current business activity.  It should be noted that the lifetime effects of hunger occurring in 2014 alone (as opposed to the impacts in a typical year as described above) are much larger and include almost $3.4 trillion in aggregate spending, over $1.5 trillion in gross product, and 15.9 million years of employment.
