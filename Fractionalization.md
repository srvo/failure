[Demographic Fractionalization and the Municipal Bond Market](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d269/161970a066856b652a21da23a47f4732eef4.pdf)

We find evidence that municipal issuers in religiously fractionalized counties pay more to borrow than those in other counties. The point estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in fractionalization (0.091) is associated with a three basis point (= 0.3025 * 0.091) increase in the offering yield of debt issued by jurisdictions in the county. A change in religious fractionalization from the level observed in highly fractionalized Juneau, Alaska (where our fractionalization index is 0.1746, indicating a 17% chance that
two randomly selected people reporting a religion are of the same religion) to highly homogeneous Rich County, Utah (where the fractionalization index is 0.8365) would be associated with a 20 basis point reduction in municipal bond yield at offering. This effect is robust to the inclusion of controls for the overall level of religious observance in a county.
