# Improper Payments

The 2002 Improper Payments Information Act and subsequent legislation have mandated official estimates of improper payments for a wide range of federal activity. "Improper payments" is not intended to mean fraud: it is a synonym for all instances where the government makes payments to the wrong person, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason. 

The reporting that stems from this legislation is helpful to the study of institutional failure. Resources made available on the US Government's [paymentaccuracy.gov](https://paymentaccuracy.gov/resources/) enumerate the largest government programs by expenditure and relates total and improper expenditures to each other through time. 

Looking just at the headline level, these payments comprise a significant percentage of total government spending.
