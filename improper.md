# Improper Payments

The 2002 Improper Payments Information Act and subsequent legislation have mandated official estimates of improper payments for a wide range of federal activity. 

"Improper payments" is not intended to mean fraud: it is a synonym for all instances where the government makes payments to the wrong person, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason. 

These payments are a meaningful percentage of total government spending every year.

The data is broken down by agency and by program. The reported improper payment rates vary quite a bit.
