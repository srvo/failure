# Improper Payments

"Improper payments" refers to all instances where the government makes payments to the wrong person, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason. 

It is distinct from fraud, but useful to examine as an indicator of blind spots that can be productively addressed. 

In the United States, three federal regulations compel agencies to produce disclosures about these sorts of payments. Those are:

* [The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002.](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ300/pdf/PLAW-107publ300.pdf)
* [The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010.](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ204/pdf/PLAW-111publ204.pdf)
* [The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2012](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ248/pdf/PLAW-112publ248.pdf)

These payments are a meaningful proportion of total government spending every year.

The disclosures issued by various branches of the federal government are [usefully aggregated](https://paymentaccuracy.gov/) to allow for exploration. 

Reported improper payment rates vary significantly by agency.

Part of this variance is because of differences in the how these agencies approach reporting. 

In 2016, the United States Government Accountability Office [noted](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/678154.pdf) "For several years, GAO has reported that the federal government is unable to determine the full extent to which improper payments occur and reasonably ensure that actions are taken to reduce them," in part because 15 of the 24 agencies shown above are [not in full compliance](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/678154.pdf) with IPERA criteria.  

155 federal government programs are broken out in publicly available [data](https://paymentaccuracy.gov/resources/). These releases show at least $144 billion in improper payments were made in the 2016 fiscal year. The 20 programs with the largest improper payments in that year account for $142 billion, 99% of the total. The top 10 account for $134 billion, or 93%.

Each of the top ten programs are critical components of the American social safety net. Examining the programs and the reasons they offer for issuing improper payments is a useful window into the federal government, and illuminates pathways for future progress. 
 
### Medicare Fee For Service

Medicare FFS reported improper payments of $41 Billion in FY 2016, 11% of their $374 Billion in outlays. The program is sometimes called (Original Medicare)[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-Enrollment/OrigMedicarePartABEligEnrol/index.html], and covered 38.2 million Americans in September 2017 according to the (Medicare Enrollment Dashboard)[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMSProgramStatistics/Dashboard.html]. 

The Department of Health and Human Services wrote "the most common cause of improper payments (accounting for 64.1 percent of total improper payments) was lack of documentation to support the services or supplies billed to Medicare. In other words, the CERT contractor reviewers could not conclude that the billed services were actually provided, were provided at the level billed, and/or were medically necessary" in their In their (2016 Improper Payments Report)[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/CERT/Downloads/MedicareFeeforService2016ImproperPaymentsReport.pdf].

### Medicaid

Medicaid reported improper payments of $36 Billion in FY 2016, 10.5% of their $345 billion in outlays. The program provides health coverage to low-income people and is one of the largest payers for health care in the United States, with 68 million people covered as of (August 2017)[https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html]. 

(Their 2016 Improper Payment Report)[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Compliance/PERM/Downloads/2016MedicaidandCHIPImproperPaymentReport.pdf] notes that a "Provider Information/Enrollment Error" was responsble for 95.8% of payments termed improper in a sample that they reviewed. This error was asserted to stem from states that are not in compliance with federal regulations.
