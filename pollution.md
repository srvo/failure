*The Lancet* commision on pollution and health [estimates](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0.pdf) that pollution was responsible for 16% of all deaths worldwide in 2015. Their survey, released in October 2017, further shows: 

* Pollution-related diseases cause productivity losses that reduce GDP in low to middle-income countries by up to 2% per year. 
* Pollution-related disease also results in health-care costs that are responsible for 1.7% of annual health spending in high-income countries and up to 7% of health spending in middle-income countries that are heavily polluted and rapidly developing. 
* Welfare losses due to pollution are estimated to amount to US$4.6 trillion per year: 6.2% of global economic output.
