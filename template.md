#Why "Institutional Failure"

TH


"The Wire is a Greek tragedy in which the postmodern institutions are the Olympian forces. It’s the police department, or the drug economy, or the political structures, or the school administration, or the macroeconomics forces that are throwing the lightning bolts and hitting people in the ass for no reason. 

In much of television, and in a good deal of our stage drama, individuals are often portrayed as rising above institutions to achieve catharsis. In this drama, the institutions always prove larger, and those characters with hubris enough to challenge the postmodern construct of American empire are invariably mocked, marginalized, or crushed. Greek tragedy for the new millenium, so to speak."

"The winners here are the people who understand the system and play it cynically (hedge funds, BigCo’s CEO & board, perhaps the acquired company’s founders & investors). The losers are everyone else – the company’s customers, the employees who lose their jobs, and the stock market investors who don’t understand the game is rigged."

"There are six or seven big institutions that are fundamentally diseased, from government to banking to housing to entitlements and the tax code.

The Simpson-Bowles report on the deficit was an opportunity to begin a wave of institutional reform. But that proposal died because our political leaders are too ideologically rigid to take on big subjects like tax reform, which involve combining Republican and Democratic ideas."

"in the last two decades, institutional failures seem very glaring. For one, hitherto well-functioning states seem to have become less effective in aggregating and acting upon citizens’ preferences. 

Many policy initiatives of the 1990s — deregulation, privatization, new public management, private regulation, regional integration, civil society, and so on — were initially billed as major social advances but now have fallen short of expectations."
