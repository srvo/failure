## How Much Does Doing Nothing Cost?

As a regular part of their work, institutions create credible estimates.

These data can be found, but are not really seen. Public, private, and nonprofit groups work in an unneccessary obscurity as a result. 

If fraud, pollution, or climate change were stocks or interest rates, every credible finding and forecast related to them would be aggregated continuously and presented according to some kind of standard. 

The Institutional Failure Index is personal attempt to estimate what's being lost. All pages should be considered public notes unless marked otherwise.
