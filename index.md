## How Much Improvement is Possible?

As a regular part of their work, institutions create credible estimates.

These data can be found, but are not really seen. If fraud, pollution, or climate change were stocks or interest rates, every credible finding and forecast related to them would be aggregated continuously and presented according to some kind of standard. 

The Institutional Failure Index collects estimates of losses that society is bearing because its governments, businesses, and nonprofits are not succeding as much as they might.
