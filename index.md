## The Institutional Failure Index

Society's resources are allocated regressively. This creates a set of difficulties that are hard to recognize and even harder to counteract.

If fraud, pollution, hunger, and similar forces were stocks or interest rates, every credible finding and forecast related to them would be aggregated continuously. They could be tied together, making it easier to see the "big picture."

The Institutional Failure Index is an attempt to connect numbers to our understanding of [Institutional Failure](institutionalfailure.md). It aggregates credible estimates, summarizes their conclusions, and hopefully makes constructive action easier.
