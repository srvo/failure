## The Institutional Failure Index

Society's resources are allocated regressively. This creates a set of difficulties that are hard to recognize and even harder to counteract.

If fraud, pollution, hunger, and similar forces were stocks or interest rates, every credible finding and forecast related to them would be aggregated continuously. Analyzing their individual costs in relation to each other is a productive way to better understand [institutional failure](institutionalfailure.md), which is often described but difficult to fully see. 

The Institutional Failure Index aggregates credible estimates, summarizes their conclusions, and hopefully makes constructive action easier.
