## How Much Does Doing Nothing Cost?

As a regular part of their work, public, private, and nonprofit organizations create credible estimates to help the public see the legitimacy of their actions. 

These data can be found, but are not fully seen. If forces like fraud, pollution, or climate change were stocks or interest rates, every credible finding and forecast related to them would be aggregated continuously. 







Things can always get better. But how much does it cost to keep them the way that they are?

This question can only be explored by examining and aggregating a lot of estimates. The purpose of this nascent project is to do exactly that. 

Pages examining a wide range of issues are under active construction.
