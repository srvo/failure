## The Institutional Failure Index

Society's resources are allocated regressively, which leads to difficulty and cost. 

If threats to social welfare had 1/100th the information transparency of financial markets, collective action might get more enlightened and efficient. 

Long-term hurt is happening in the meantime because it's hard to describe. [Institutional Failure](institutionalfailure.md) - where multiple organizations succumb to inflexibility, inefficiency, and inadequacy in service of their community - is a tricky phenomenon to counteract. 

The purpose of the Institutional Failure Index is to aggregate credible information about the cost of business as usual. 

Your help pulling in more information and interest in their findings are both appreciated. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/srvo/failure/pulls), sign up [for brief, interesting emails](http://eepurl.com/c-hM25), and read [Sloane's blog](http://srvo.org/) for more information.
